## BACKGROUND 
### Problem Study 
Little Lemon aspires to open another branch; however, before proceeding with this expansion project, they must first identify strategies to increase their sales and pinpoint the locations where most of their loyal customers reside. As a data analyst, your task is to utilize the available data to assist Little Lemon in making informed, data-driven decisions for the successful planning of their new branch.

## DATA PREPROCESSING
### Data Collection
The dataset was acquired from the Google Coursera Data Analytics study materials.
### Data Description
The following code snippet was executed to load the dataframe into the program.
```py 
dataframe = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/cse20-054/Documents/My Projects/DataAnalysis/Python/Little Lemon Project/Little Lemon.csv')
```

The code snippet below was used to describe the data provided.
```py 
# DATA DESCRPTION
print('DATA INFORMATION: ', dataframe.info())
print('DATA DESCPRITION: ', dataframe.describe())
print('DATA SHAPE: ', dataframe.shape)
```
The provided dataset consisted of 21,000 entries and comprises 21 columns. The column names and the types of data contained in each column are as follows:

- Row number: Natural numbers
- Order ID: Letters
- Order Date: Letters
- Delivery Date: Letters
- Customer ID: Letters
- Customer Name: Letters
- City: Letters
- Country: Letters
- Postal Code: Letters
- Country Code: Letters
- Cost: Decimal numbers
- Sales: Decimal numbers
- Quantity: Natural numbers
- Discount: Decimal numbers
- Delivery Cost: Decimal numbers
- Course Name: Letters
- Cuisine Name: Letters
- Starter Name: Letters
- Dessert Name: Letters
- Drinks: Letters
- Sides: Letters.

### Data Cleaning
```py
# DATA CLEANING
no_null_dataframe = dataframe.dropna(axis=0)
print('Null values dropped!')

no_repeating_dataset = no_null_dataframe.drop_duplicates()
print('Duplicates dropped!')

no_repeating_dataset_lower = no_repeating_dataset.applymap(lambda x: x.lower() if isinstance(x, str) else x)
print('String values converted to lower case!')

columns_to_drop = ['Row Number', 'Order ID', 'Delivery Date', 'Customer Name', 'Country', 'Postal Code', 'Country Code', 'Delivery Cost']
no_repeating_dataset_lower.drop(columns=columns_to_drop) # Drop the specified columns
print('Unused columns dropped!')

my_dataframe = no_repeating_dataset_lower
```

As shown in the above provided code snipper null and repeated entries were removed, and text was converted to lowercase. After cleaning, the dataset consisted of 20,999 entries and 13 vital columns. 

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
### Key Statistics
```py
# 1. SALES
# Descriptive Statistics
stats = my_dataframe['Sales'].describe()

# Additional Statistics
mean = my_dataframe['Sales'].mean()
median = my_dataframe['Sales'].median()
mode = my_dataframe['Sales'].mode().iloc[0]
std_dev = my_dataframe['Sales'].std()
quartiles = my_dataframe['Sales'].quantile([0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
```
The code snippet provided above was executed to obtain sales statistics. Sales have the following statistics:
- Mean: 220.55
- Median: 220.55
- Mode: 66.86
- Standard Deviation: 114.81
- Min: 66.86
- Max: 480
- Count: 20,958
- Quartiles: 25% - 137.76, 50% - 186.93, 75% - 315.0

```py
unique_customer_ids = my_dataframe['Customer ID'].nunique()
unique_cities = my_dataframe['City'].nunique()
unique_courses = my_dataframe['Cuisine Name'].nunique()
```
Additionally, Little Lemon has 998 customers in 973 cities, ordering from three cuisines and the above code snippet was utilized to obtain these values.

### Visualization
#### 1. Customers ordering each cuisine

The fourth city with the highest total sales is Su-ngai Kolok, contributing 19.9% to the total sales. Napoli follows with a total sales percentage of 20%. Thap Than secures the second-highest sales at 20.1%, while Hamilton claims the top spot with 20.2% of total sales.
